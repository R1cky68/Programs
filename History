            <h4> Family </h4>
            I was born in New Delhi in 18th of December, 2001.
            My family lineage can be extensive, both my grandfathers were farmers who migrated to the city for better work opportunities.
            From my dad's side, he started a furniture business whilst from my mum's side it was a photography one.
            They worked hard for years until they had families of their own who would eventually inherit it.
            Our family lived like this for a while, but they passed away unfortunately over the years.
            Tensions within the families would unfortunately grow, leading to a split with my parents + older uncle and everyone else.
            It reached a boiling point in 2007 my parents decided to leave to settle in Australia. This is because my aunty from my mum's side lived here already.
            Unfortunately the drama also followed, my uncle from mum's side had also tagged along which will lead to more problems.
            Over the years my parents worked in 7-eleven in sydney and caltex in maroochydore/currimundi, and split in/out with my uncles/aunty here. It was simulataneously a close bond with us kids but tensions/drama within adults.
            This continued for around 10 years until we split with the problematic uncle for good, everyone almost collectively cut him off. There were also many recent changes in this time, but I'll spare the details here.
            We eventually moved to Brisbane in 2020 for my uni from the sunshine coast, with my parents getting their independent business in gold coast. Finally good house too in Underwood. Things have been like that ever since.

            So that is my family history. We started out reasonably wealthy, lost a fair amount, then worked ourselves back up again.
